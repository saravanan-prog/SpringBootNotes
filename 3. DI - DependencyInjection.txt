What is Dependency Injection (DI)
----------------------------------

   - DI is a technique where one object supplies the dependencies (services or components) another object needs.

   - Instead of a class creating or looking up its dependencies, they are injected from outside, typically by a framework like Spring.

   - This reduces tight coupling and makes code easier to maintain and test.



Types of Dependency Injection
-----------------------------
    1. Constructor Injection  -  Dependencies are provided through the class constructor.
    2. Setter Injection       -  Dependencies are set through setter methods after object creation.
    3. Field Injection        -  Dependencies are injected directly into fields.



In short
========

    IoC: Framework controls object creation & lifecycle.
    DI:  Framework injects dependencies into classes.
