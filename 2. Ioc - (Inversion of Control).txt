IoC (Inversion of Control) :-
=============================
    - IoC is a design principle where the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework.

    - Instead of your code creating and managing objects, the framework controls their lifecycle and dependencies.

    - It inverts the traditional flow of control — hence the name.


Why is IoC Important
====================
    - It loosely couples components by removing direct dependencies.
    - Makes code more flexible, maintainable, and testable.
    - Helps manage object creation, configuration, and wiring automatically.


In short
--------
    IoC: Framework controls object creation & lifecycle.
